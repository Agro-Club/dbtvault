  @fixture.single_source_hub
  Scenario: [PM-BASE Full refresh of loaded hub
    Given the HUB table does not exist
    And the RAW_STAGE table contains data
      | CUSTOMER_ID | CUSTOMER_NAME | CUSTOMER_DOB | LOAD_DATE  | SOURCE |
      | 1001        | Alice         | 1997-04-24   | 1993-01-01 | TPCH   |
      | 1002        | Bob           | 2006-04-17   | 1993-01-01 | TPCH   |
    And I hash the stage
    And I use insert_by_period to load the HUB hub by day
    Then the HUB table should contain expected data
      | CUSTOMER_PK | CUSTOMER_ID | LOAD_DATE  | SOURCE |
      | md5('1001') | 1001        | 1993-01-01 | TPCH   |
      | md5('1002') | 1002        | 1993-01-01 | TPCH   |
