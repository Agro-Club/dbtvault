With each release we will be adding more Data Vault 2.0 tables and helpful macros.
We hope to tailor new features to the requirements of our community, making the package 
the best and most useful it can be.

We will be releasing changes incrementally rather than jumping from Release 0.1 to Release 0.2 and beyond, so you can reap 
the benefits as soon as features are developed.
