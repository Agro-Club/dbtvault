## We'd love to hear from you

This dbtvault package is very much a work in progress – we’ll up the version number to 1.0 when we’re satisfied it 
works out in the wild.

We know that it deserves new features, that the code base can be tidied up and the SQL better tuned. 
Rest assured we’re working on it for future releases – our roadmap contains information on what’s coming.

If you spot anything you’d like to bring to our attention, have a request for new features, 
have spotted an improvement we could make, or want to tell us about a typo, then please don’t hesitate to let us know 
by submitting an issue using the below guidelines

We’d rather know you are making active use of this package than hearing nothing from all of you out there!

Happy Data Vaulting!

## Issue guidelines

### If it's a bug
We've tested the package rigorously, but if you think you've found a bug please provide the following 
at a minimum (or use the issue templates) so we can fix it as quickly as possible:

- The version of dbtvault being used (as we're still in pre-release, this can be omitted)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any error messages or dbt log files which can give more detail of the problem

### If it's a feature request
We'd love to add new features to make this package even more useful for the community,
please feel free to submit ideas and thoughts!

## Pull requests
If you've developed something which we can add via a pull request, we'd prefer that you submit an issue first
so that we can discuss the changes.
